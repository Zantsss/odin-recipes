            <li>Roll dough out to a thickness of 5mm. Cut the dough into 10mm strips. Take 3 strips and join their ends on one side. Braid the strips to desired length and join other ends.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil iin a pot until fairly hot. Place about 3 koeksisters at a time in the oil and fry both sides until a golden-brown colour.
